# Stock Price Prediction using Bi-LSTM

This project uses a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model to predict the closing stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The model is trained on historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, and the goal is to forecast the stock price for future days.

## Features

- **Bi-LSTM Model**: A deep learning model used to predict time series data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data scaling, sequence generation, and train/test split.
- **Visualization**: Plots to visualize true vs predicted stock prices and performance metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores to evaluate model performance.
