# Stock Price Prediction using Bi-LSTM

This project uses a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model to predict the closing stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The model is trained on historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, and the goal is to forecast the stock price for future days.

## Features

- **Bi-LSTM Model**: A deep learning model used to predict time series data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data scaling, sequence generation, and train/test split.
- **Visualization**: Plots to visualize true vs predicted stock prices and performance metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and R² scores to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the historical stock data of Apple Inc. (AAPL) available from Yahoo Finance, retrieved via the `yfinance` Python package. The dataset includes:

- Date: Trading date
